For more detailed\ndescriptions of commands available, check out [the Modulus\ncodex](https://modulus.io/codex/cli/reference).\n\n##Installing\n\nTo install the Modulus CLI, simply NPM install it globally.\n\n    $ npm install -g modulus\n\n##Usage\n\nUsing the CLI is easy.\n\n    Usage: modulus <command> <param1> <param2>\n\nAt any point you can run the *help* command to get a full list of commands and\nhow to use them.\n\nYou can also send feedback directly to Modulus using the *contact* command. Make\nsure your message is enclosed in double quotes (eg. “Your message”).\n\n    $ modulus contact \"This is feedback from the CLI!\"\n    Welcome to Modulus\n    You are logged in as spiderman\n    [√] Feedback sent. Thank you for the message.\n\n##Creating an Account\n\nTo start, you may need an account. Using the *signup* command, you can quickly\ncreate an account to get things rolling. It will prompt you for a few required\npieces of information then set up an account.\n\n    $ modulus signup\n    Welcome to Modulus\n    In order to sign up we a few pieces of information.\n    [?] Choose a username: spiderman\n    [?] Enter a valid email: parker@example.com\n    [?] Enter a password:\n    [√] User spiderman has been created successfully.\n\n    You should receive an email at parker@example.com with more information.\n\nOnce you have an account, you need to log in. Running the *login* command will\nprompt you for your Modulus credentials or if you have linked your GitHub\naccount in the web portal (under account settings) you can use the *--github*\nflag to login using your GitHub credentials. This keeps a session open so you\ncan run commands under your account and the session will not be closed unless\nyou run the *logout* command or log in with a different account.\n\n    $ modulus login\n    Welcome to Modulus\n    [?] Enter your username or email: spiderman\n    [?] Enter your password:\n    [√] Signed in as user spiderman\n\n##Project Management\n\nOnce logged in, you are ready to create a project. This is done with the\n*project create* command, and all that is required is a name.\n\n    $ modulus project create\n    Welcome to Modulus\n    You are logged in as spiderman\n    [?] Enter a project name: Lizard Locator\n    [√] New project Lizard Locator created.\n\nYou can optionally pass in the name with *project create*.\n\n    $ modulus project create \"Lizard Locator\"\n    Welcome to Modulus\n    You are logged in as spiderman\n    Creating project Lizard Locator\n    [√] New project Lizard Locator created.\n\nTo deploy an application to your new project, you can use either the *project\ndeploy* command or its shorter sidekick, *deploy*. This command will take all\nthe contents of your current directory, zip them up and deploy them. Once the\ndeploy has started, the progress will be displayed. When the deploy completes,\nyou have a running application on Modulus. You can redeploy a new version of the\nproject at any time using the same process.\n\n    $ cd my/project/directory\n    $ modulus deploy\n    Welcome to Modulus\n    You are logged in as spiderman\n    [?] Are you sure you want to use project Lizard Locator?

You should see\nsome information about Modulus' activity, as well as the NPM install process. In\nfuture deploy examples, these logs will be replaced for \"...\".\n\nYou can also pass in a directory as a command argument, if you do not want to\ndeploy the current directory.\n\n    $ modulus deploy my/project/directory\n    Welcome to Modulus\n    You are logged in as spiderman\n    [?] Are you sure you want to use project Lizard Locator?

(yes) yes\n    Project Lizard Locator Environment Variables\n    NODE_ENV = production\n\nTo add a new variable, use the *env set* command. It takes two parameters, name\nand value. This command can also be used to change the value of an existing\nvariable.\n\n    $ modulus env set DB_AUTH 12345\n    Welcome to Modulus\n    You are logged in as spiderman\n    [?] Are you sure you want to use project Lizard Locator? (yes) yes\n    Setting DB_AUTH for project Lizard Locator\n    [√] Successfully set environment variable.\n\nIf you have no need for a variable anymore, you can provide the *env delete*\ncommand with a name and it will be removed from the project.\n\n    $ modulus env delete DB_AUTH\n    Welcome to Modulus\n    You are logged in as spiderman\n    [?] Are you sure you want to use project Lizard Locator? (yes) yes\n    Deleting DB_AUTH for project Lizard Locator\n    [√] Successfully deleted variable DB_AUTH from project Lizard Locator\n\nAt any time, if you want to view the value of a single variable, use the *env\nget* command. It takes a name parameter and will display the value of the\nvariable of the name you specify.\n\n##MongoDB Database Management\n\nOnce logged in, you can create a MongoDB database. This is done with the *mongo\ncreate* command, and all that is required is a name.\n\n    $ modulus mongo create\n    Welcome to Modulus\n    You are logged in as spiderman\n    [?] Enter a database name: Lizard Locator DB\n    [√] New MongoDB database Lizard Locator DB created.\n\nYou can optionally pass in the name with *mongo create*.\n\n    $ modulus mongo create \"Lizard Locator DB\"\n    Welcome to Modulus\n    You are logged in as spiderman\n    Creating MongoDB database Lizard Locator DB\n    [√] New MongoDB database Lizard Locator DB created.\n\nOnce a database has been created a user should be added to it. Use the *mongo\nuser create* command to create a database user.\n\n    $ modulus mongo user create\n    Welcome to Modulus\n    You are logged in as spiderman\n    Please choose which database to use:\n      1) Lizard Locator DB\n      2) Green Goblin DB\n    [?] database 2\n    Selected MongoDB database Green Goblin DB.\n    [?] Enter username: johnny\n    [?] Enter password: five\n    [?] Read only permissions? (yes) no\n    [✓] New MongoDB database user johnny created.\n\n## API Tokens\n\nIt is possible to invoke commands that require authentication without logging\ninto a user account by using API tokens. This is especially useful when\nautomating actions such as deploys or sharing a Modulus project with multiple\ndevelopers without sharing a user name and password.\n\n    $ modulus token create\n    Welcome to Modulus\n    You are logged in as spiderman\n    [✓] Token: API-TOKEN\n\nAPI Tokens use the MODULUS_TOKEN environment variable and can be used with any\ncommand that requires authentication.\n\n    $ MODULUS_TOKEN=API-TOKEN modulus deploy\n    Welcome to Modulus\n    You are logged in as spiderman\n    [?] Are you sure you want to use project Lizard Locator? (yes)\n    ...\n\nManage the API tokens that you have created using the list and remove commands.\n\n    $ modulus token list\n    Welcome to Modulus\n    You are logged in as spiderman\n    Current tokens:\n    API-TOKEN\n\n    $ modulus token remove API-TOKEN\n    Welcome to Modulus\n    You are logged in as spiderman\n    [✓] Token successfully removed.\n\n##Logs\n\nIn times when you need to check up on your projects, you can view the project's\nlogs. This is done with the *project logs* command, which supports the *-p*\noption.\n\n    $ modulus project logs -p \"Lizard Locator\"\n    Welcome to Modulus\n    You are logged in as spiderman\n    INFO: Attaching persistent storage.\n    INFO: Found package.json file: /package.json\n    INFO: Node version not specified in package.json, using latest stable version.\n    INFO: Initializing Node v0.10.13\n    INFO: Running npm install.\n    INFO: Registry: http://registry.npmjs.org\n    npm http GET http://registry.npmjs.org/express\n    npm http 304 http://registry.npmjs.org/express\n    npm http GET http://registry.npmjs.org/qs\n    npm http GET http://registry.npmjs.org/connect\n    npm http GET http://registry.npmjs.org/mime/1.2.4\n    npm http GET http://registry.npmjs.org/mkdirp/0.3.0\n    npm http 304 http://registry.npmjs.org/qs\n    npm http 304 http://registry.npmjs.org/connect\n    npm http 304 http://registry.npmjs.org/mime/1.2.4\n    npm http 304 http://registry.npmjs.org/mkdirp/0.3.0\n    npm http GET http://registry.npmjs.org/mime/-/mime-1.2.4.tgz\n    npm http GET http://registry.npmjs.org/mkdirp/-/mkdirp-0.3.0.tgz\n    npm http GET http://registry.npmjs.org/qs/-/qs-0.4.2.tgz\n    npm http 200 http://registry.npmjs.org/mime/-/mime-1.2.4.tgz\n    npm http 200 http://registry.npmjs.org/mkdirp/-/mkdirp-0.3.0.tgz\n    npm http 200 http://registry.npmjs.org/qs/-/qs-0.4.2.tgz\n    npm http GET http://registry.npmjs.org/formidable\n    npm http 304 http://registry.npmjs.org/formidable\n    express@2.5.11 node_modules/express\n    ├── qs@0.4.2\n    ├── mime@1.2.4\n    ├── mkdirp@0.3.0\n    └── connect@1.9.2 (formidable@1.0.14)\n    INFO: Main file found: /app.js\n    INFO: Starting application.\n    Express server started on port 8080\n    [2013-08-22T17:53:42.245Z] Application initialized with pid 11010\n\n    [✓] Logs successfully retrieved.\n\nWhile these logs are not streamed directly to the CLI, the logs themselves are\nupdated in real-time, so anytime you retrieve them they are current.\n",
